* Use Stochastic Gradient Descent.
* Achieve 97-98% accuracy on the Test Set.
- [ ] HW02
* Implement and train a convolution neural network from scratch in Python for the MNIST dataset.
* Have a single hidden layer with multiple channels. 
* Achieve 94% accuracy on the Test Set. 
- [ ] HW03
* Train a deep convolution network on a GPU with PyTorch for the CIFAR10 dataset. 
* The convolution network use (i) dropout, (ii) trained with RMSprop or ADAM, and (iii) data augmentation. 
* Compare dropout test accuracy (i) using the heuristic prediction rule and (ii) Monte Carlo simulation.
